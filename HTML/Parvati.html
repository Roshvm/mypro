<h1><b> <i>Prayers of Parvati</i></b></h1> 
    I was sitting by the banks of the Parvati <br>
    when a prayer came fluttering in the wind <br>
    it was softer than a whisper <br>
    fainter than the rustling of leaves <br>
    The gurgle of the river didnt disturb it <br>
    nor did the song of the Blue whisling thrush <br>
    Was it meant for me by the lips that birthed it? <br>
    I would never know <br>
    and shall not seek for that knowledge <br>
    for I badly needed the prayer <br>
    and couldnt afford to pass it on. <br>
    Far away, in a Himalayan shrine <br>
    surrounded by Buransh blooms <br>
    the wind kissed the prayer flags goodbye <br>
    before it set out on a journey <br>
    one of no return or destination <br>
